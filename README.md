This Task View focuses on useful tools for R Packages Development,
grouped by topics.

If you think that some packages/tools are missing from the list, please

Creation
--------

### Creating R packages

[pkgKitten](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pkgKitten/index.html)

Source code
-----------

### Foreign Languages Interfaces

-   The
    [inline](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/inline/index.html)
    package eases adding code in C, C++ or Fortran to R. It takes care
    of the compilation, linking and loading of embeded code segments
    that are stored as R strings.
-   The [Rcpp](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rcpp/index.html)
    package offers a number of C++ clases that makes transferring R
    objects to C++ functions (and back) easier.
-   The [rJava](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rJava/index.html)
    package by Urbanek provides a low-level interface to Java similar to
    the `.Call()` interface for C and C++.

### Debugging

### Code Analysis

### Profiling

-   The [profr](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/profr/index.html)
    package by Wickham can visualize output from the `Rprof` interface
    for profiling.
-   The
    [proftools](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/proftools/index.html)
    package by Tierney, and the
    [aprof](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/aprof/index.html)
    package by Visser, can also be used to analyse profiling output.

### Benchmarking

### Unit Testing

[RUnit](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RUnit/index.html)
[testthat](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/testthat/index.html)

Documentation
